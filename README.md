# CS663 Project 2 — Model Training (Repo A)

This repository contains the training notebook, TensorBoard curves, dataset examples, and testing outputs for our sidewalk object detection system. The model was trained/fine-tuned using an EfficientDet-Lite0 architecture with TensorFlow.

## Contents
- `efficientdet_training.ipynb` — Colab notebook used for training and logging TensorBoard metrics.
- `loss.png` — Screenshot of TensorBoard showing training vs validation loss.
- `accuracy.png` — Screenshot of TensorBoard showing training vs validation accuracy.
- Additional images and testing examples will be added to the Wiki.

## Wiki Pages
The Wiki contains:
- **data** — examples of images used for training/testing + dataset Drive link  
- **results** — TensorBoard accuracy/loss curves and explanations  
- **testing** — 10 test image results (input + output)

This repo fulfills Requirement (A) of CS663 Project 2.
